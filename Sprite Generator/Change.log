	• Made changes to prevent errors in loading images just in case

	• Reduced CPU usage a lot. Nearly half.

	• All the buttons, check boxes, and other Objects in the
	  UI will no longer flicker when they are being changed or
	  highlighted over. This has been annoying me for a long
	  time.

	• Fixed an error where if the "config.cfg" file was 
	  missing Sprite Creator 3 would not load.

12/06/2013:
	• Fixed a bug with the UI that would keep the image from 
	  displaying properly depending on what choices were made
	  in a certain order.

	• Recolored all the Male Objects. Female Objects will be 
	  colored here soon.

	• Changed the way images are stored within Sprite Creator 
	  3 at runtime. Getting ready for some big changes to how 
	  you use Sprite Creator 3

	  and Female the preview windows will no longer flicker.

	• Very large base code change.
	• There is now a check box, that will be improved upon, 
	  that makes the Animation Preview Window one frame 4
	  times larger than the original image. You then can use
	  the arrows to change the direction of the Animated
	  Preview

	• Added the option to save the XP image as a VX image in 
	  the standard 3x4 frames

12/01/2013:
	• You can now import custom multi-layered images. 
	  Currently only Hair has more than one layer. To import a
	  second layer or the "Back/Behind the character" image 
	  rename the behind image like this 1_red_b.png The front
	  image should be labled as 1_red.png
	• Changed the Config file added an override feature for 
	  multil-layered images.
	• If the config file is unable to load. A config.cfg file 
	  with the default values will be created and the program 
	  will then try to load from the config again.

	• Added a Hat option for both male and female.
	• You can now switch the drawing order between boots and 
	  pants
	• Added Shirt and Long Shirt option for both male and
	  female
	• Fixed a bug where reloading male or female while using 
	  the other sex would result in the selection window 
	  resetting as well for the current selected sex rather 
	  than maintaining the current selected window. This is 
	  now working correctly.
	• Saving all layers has been added back into Sprite 
	  Creator 3 XP. Not sure how it was removed.
	• Changed the draw order a bit to accomidate the new 
	  objects that are available now.
