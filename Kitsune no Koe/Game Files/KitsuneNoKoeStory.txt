Kitsune no Koe AKA Fox Adventure AKA Bordy's boosheet game

Scene 1: Leo's ABAP house

(Leo standing near the door)
Leo - *Sigh* It's so cold today... I really wish I didn't have to go to work again today... But if we want to keep warm, I've got to keep helping out...

Ruby (Leo's sister) - (walks in) Leo! Wait! Don't leave just yet!

Leo - Why? I've got to get going now, or I'll be late.

Ruby - Just hold on a sec, okay? (she walks off screen)

Leo - What's this about...

Ruby - (walks back in) I've got a birthday present for you! I made it myself!

Leo - ...Birthday present?

Ruby - Hehe, yeah, of course! You didn't forget your own birthday did you?

Leo - Hehe... of course not. So, what's the present?

Ruby - Tadah! It's a purple scarf! Isn't it cool? It should help you stay warm at work! 

Leo - ...

Ruby - ...What is it? Don't you like it?

Leo - Erm... No, I love it. It's cool, I'll wear it now, see?

Ruby - Hehe! Yay! Oh, that's right! Make sure you come back soon after work, okay? Mom and Dad are going to be home tonight too, so we can spend your birthday together!
So don't stay out tonight!

Leo - Alright, I'll be back as soon as I can then. I've really got to leave now though, alright? I'll see you tonight.

Ruby - Bye, Leo!

----

(Outside) 

Leo - <It's so cold out today... I guess this scarf is pretty warm at least, even if it looks a little weird...>
        <I'm so tired of this everyday... It seems like all I ever do is work... But, it's for Ruby's sake, I suppose...>

(Player controls this part to walk down the street until a certain point, with an alleyway, should be some NPCs and shiz in this part to keep it from feeling too empty and short)


(Music effects play upon reaching it)

Leo - Huh...? Music? That's odd.
      - I almost never get to hear music... It sounds so nice. But I don't really have time to stand around here... I've got to get going.


Leo - ...
       <It's so mezmorizing though... I really wish I could stay and listen...>

(Leo runs off)

(at train station shizzy wizzy bawizzy klizzy)

Leo - Sigh... I hate this job... I haven't heard such nice music like that in so long, and I couldn't stay for hardly a moment to listen...
     - It's not like I have a choice... I might as well not get upset over it.

(Train arrives if you can show it, if not just show something to show it's later)

Leo - So cold today... I should hurry home.

(player control back to street until the alley)
(music sounds again)
Leo - Huh? That music is still playing!
      - I guess it would be okay if I listened for a minute now...
(Leo moves into the alley where the light thing is)
Leo - Huh...? What's with this light...
      - It seems like the music is coming out of it!
      - ...What happens if I touch it...?
??? - No! Get away! Stop!
Leo - Wh-what?! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...!
??? - Get away from me!

(Screen flashes white)

Leo - Gah! Wha....?

(Library area)


Leo - (Wha... What happened?)
      - (A... library? But... it's not quite a normal library, is it...)
      - (Is this some kind of dream? Wasn't I just walking home though...?)
      

*Music echoes through the library*

     -(It's that song from before! Where is it coming from? This way?)

<controlled part where you walk through the map>

<Music cuts out at the end>

  -(What? It stopped...)

??? - Kyaaah! Get away from me! I'm not going with you!

Leo - What?! Who's there? What's going on!

??? - No! Stop it! 
<screen turns white>
Leo - Gah! What's happening...
      - What... is this...
      - I...

<Crescent Woods>

(Leo is passed out on the ground and gets up  if you can show that somehow idk)

Leo - Huh...? Was I asleep?
      - Does that mean it was a dream? But why am I in the woods?
      - And it's so hot in these clothes... and the trees... 
      - W-what...? It isn't winter? What the hell happened?

??? - Hey! You there!

Leo - Huh? Who's there?

??? - Over here!

<Reason walks into the map>

Leo - Wh... Who are you? What's with that weird outfit?

??? - Hmm? You're one to talk, aren't you? Isn't that a bit warm?

Leo - Huh...? Well, I guess...

??? - Sorry, but I don't have time to chat. Did you see a Fox go through here?

Leo - A fox...?

??? - Yes, yes, that's what I said, isn't it? Did you see one or not?

Leo - Umm, no... Where is this, anyway?

??? - Listen, it's very important that I find this fox, alright? If I don't find it, something very bad will happen, you understand?

Leo - Huh...? What's so important about a fox...? Anyway, can't you tell me where I am?

??? - It's the Crescent Woods, alright? Anyway, it's imperative that I find it, so I need to continue searching.

Leo - If I help you find her, would you at least answer a few questions for me?

??? - Yes, yes, certainly. If you manage to find her, I'll answer anything you might want to know, okay? If you see her, return to this glade and shout, the forest is fairly small, so I'll most likely hear it.
      
Leo - Umm... Sure. I guess I'll look around a bit, then.

??? - Oh, and she is quite the trickster, if she tries to play any kind of trick on you, just don't listen, and shout for me.

Leo - Huh? Tricks?

<Reason walks off>

Leo - What does he mean by that... A fox playing tricks?
      - Anyway, I guess I should help look...

<player controlled part>

<after reaching a certain point>

??? - Psst! Hey you! Over here!

Leo - Huh? Me?

??? - Yeah! Come here!

Leo - W-what? Where?

??? - Over here! The bush!

Leo - ...Umm

??? - Come on! Please? I need help!

Leo - Erm... Alright...

<Leo moves to the bush>

Leo - Uhh... Where are you? It's dark and I can't really see...

??? - I need you to get me out of here to the village, alright? Just let me hide in your coat!

Leo - W-What?! Hide in my coat?

??? - Just don't freak out, okay? I can't let him see me!

<Ikari jumps out and goes into leo's coat>

Leo - H-hey! A fox! What the...!

??? - Shh! Be quiet!

Leo - You're talking?! What?! I really must be dreaming...

??? - You're not dreaming! And be quiet! I can't let him find me!

Leo - No... This has to be a dream right... I'll just wake up and...

Leo - ...

Leo - ......

Leo - I'm not waking up...

??? - Because it's not a dream! Now come on! We need to go to the village!

Leo - What village? I don't even know where this is!

Leo - Wait... That guy told me to not let a fox trick me! You're trying to trick me, aren't you?!

??? - No! I'm not! Please be quiet! Don't let him hear!

Leo - Hey! She's over he- OUCH! You bit me!

??? - I'm sorry! Just stop! Please! Just get me away from here and we can talk, alright?

Leo - Why should I trust a talking fox so quickly? Especially since you just bit me!

??? - I said sorry! Please... I'm begging you... I'll tell you how to get to the village!

Leo - ...Fine. Fine! This is way too weird, and I'm still not convinced this isn't a dream, so fine! Let's go to the village!

??? - Thank you! Now please, let's hurry!

<player controlled part to go to village>

Leo - Hey! This is the place, right?

??? - Yeah! It's Crescent Village! We need to get to the Shrine in the back of the village!

Leo - Uh, sure, Let's go.

<player control shiiiiiiz>

Leo - Is this it? The shrine?

??? - Yes! Now hurry and get inside before that guy comes around!

<walk inside>

??? - Whew... We should be safe here for now, he already came to look for me in here earlier, so he shouldn't be back for a while at least.

Leo - So are you going to tell me what the hell is going on? I'm so confused... If this isn't a dream, then where am I? And who are you anyway? Why did that guy want to find a talking fox so bad? Are you part of a circus or something?

??? - A what...? No! Listen, I don't know for sure why they want me exactly, but I know it isn't good! Those guys are evil! ...And anyway, I'm a Kitsune! Stop saying Fox!

Leo - Uhh, sure... Anyway, what do you mean Those guys? Are there more weird guys like him?

??? - Yes! He's part of the Mordian wolves! I don't know what it is they're after exactly, but they've been trying to kidnap me!

Leo - Mordian wolves...? I don't know what any of that stuff is...

??? - Wait... You're the one I summoned, aren't you?! Why didn't I notice sooner?!

Leo - Huh?! You summoned me?!

??? - I tried to summon someone to help, but I thought it failed! I guess you're the one that came!

Leo - What? But why me?! I'm not special!

??? - Well... I'm not too great at summoning yet, really. So, I was just kind of summoning randomly...

Leo - ...Huh?! Isn't that a bad idea?! You could have summoned someone that would just make it worse!

??? - Well... I was just relying on fate. Whatever happened was fated to happen, and you helped me, didn't you? So it's turned out fine so far!

Leo - I guess so...

??? - Anyway, I haven't even told you my name yet!
Ikari - I'm Ikari!     
 
Leo - Ikari? What a strange name...

Ikari - Hmmph! It's not strange! It's a normal name for a Kitsune!
       - What's your name?

Leo - My name is Leo.

Ikari - Leo? Really?

Leo - ...Yeah?

Ikari - *Snicker* And you said my name was weird...

Leo - ...Well sorry! This is all foreign to me you know! I'm still kind of in a state of disbelief at all this...

Ikari - Well it's real! And I need your help!

Leo - Why should I help you anyway? What do I get out of it?

Ikari - Would you rather be left to fend for yourself in this place?

Leo - ...That's not very fair after you summoned me here, you know...

Ikari - I'll make it up to you, alright? Wait here a second! I need to get my flute out from it's hiding spot out back, then we need to get moving out of here!

Leo - We're going to just leave in the middle of the night?

Ikari - It's Crescent Woods! It's always night!

Leo - Wha...?

<Ikari goes out the door>

Leo - (I guess I might as well go along with her... I mean this can't be real anyway, right? I'm sure it's a dream...)
      - (But... I don't remember ever getting home after work... I was supposed to have my birthday party too... )
      - (All I remember was that weird song from the alley, and then... a light and... Wait.)
      - (She said she was getting her flute... That song was on a flute too, wasn't it?)
      - (Did she really summon me here? Is this... actually real?)
      - (Ruby... I've got to get home somehow...)
Ikari - Wh-What?! Where is it?!

Leo - Huh?

Ikari - It's gone! My flute was stolen!

<Leo moves outside to where she is>

Leo - What's going on? Someone stole your flute?

Ikari - Yes! I need that flute! It's very important!

Leo - What's this?

<There's a note pinned to a nearby tree>

Leo - A note?

Ikari - Give me it! Let me see!

Ikari - It's barely legible...

Leo - What's it say?

Ikari - "We take pretty stick. Ours forever! You no take back. Ours! We make pretty sound! -Kobolds"

Leo - ...

Ikari - You've got to be kidding me! The kobolds stole it! Of course they did!

Leo - Kobolds...?

Ikari - Listen, we've got to get it back! I know where their cave is!
       - They're pretty weak, so you should be able to fight through them, but I can't fight without my flute!

Leo - Huh? You want me to fight them? That sounds dangerous...

Ikari - It's fine, they're stupid and weak, so I'm sure they won't be an issue. But we need to get that flute back!

Leo - If you say so...

Ikari - The cave is to the south! Let's go!

Leo - (How does a Fox play a flute anyway...)

<Controlled shiz>

<write the dungeon parts and I'll rewrite>

-end of dungeon-

Leo - That was crazy... I can't believe we actually went and fought monsters like that...

Ikari - Huh? But Kobolds are weak, it's not like it was a big deal.

Leo - Where I come from, stuff like that only happens in made-up stories! Stuff like monsters don't exist! You don't understand how weird all of this is to me!

Ikari - There's no monsters where you're from...? That sure sounds nice... If I never had to deal with monsters...

Leo - Well... It's not like my old life was great anyway...

Ikari - Huh? 

Leo - I get forced to work every day just so my family has enough money to eat and have a home... I almost never get to hear things like music, and lately it's been so cold...

Ikari - You never get to hear music? Oh... That's kind of sad, huh?

Leo - Oh, uh, I guess so...

Ikari - Hehe~, well, I'll play music for you any time you like, okay? If you stay with me a while longer and help me out, I'll play as much as you want, okay?

Leo - Huh...? You still need my help? I just want to go home though...

Ikari - Didn't you just say you didn't even like your old life? And besides...

Leo - (But Ruby... I can't just...)

Ikari - I don't ~really~ know how to send you back anyway...

Leo - Wh-what?! You don't?!

Ikari - Heh... Hey, I said I'm not that great at summoning yet didn't I? Maybe if I practice and learned a bit more I could do it eventually...

Leo - Eventually?! I was supposed to be back home tonight! It was... My birthday today...

Ikari - Oh... Really? I'm sorry... I shouldn't have summoned you, it was pretty selfish, wasn't it...

Leo - *Sigh...* Come on... You don't have to feel sad... You were in danger, and I guess since I was able to help you out, it's fine...

Ikari - Don't try to make me feel better about it! It was selfish! I'll try my best to make up for it, okay? Just please, stick around and help me a while longer!

      - Are you hungry, if we go to Lalabay City, I can find us something to eat!

Leo - I guess I am pretty hungry, actually...

Ikari - Alright! Let's go then! It should be safer there anyway, there's lots of people, so if that guy shows up again, everyone would see him.

<ikari explains where to go or something and you walk there>

Ikari - Alright here we are, this is Lalabay City!

Leo - Wow... It's like a story book here...

     - So, we can get something to eat here? Is there a market or something?

Ikari - Yeah there is! We just have to-- Um... Oh wait...

Leo - Huh? What is it?

Ikari - Well... I don't actually have money right now, I forgot... I spent it all on apples a while ago...

Leo - ...So we can't get anything to eat, then?

Ikari - W-Well, there should be something on the job board in town! There usually is! We just clean someone's store or move some boxes or something and we can eat!

<find the job board in town, NPCs tell you where it is or something>

Leo - This is the job board? Let's see...

Leo - Experienced sailors wanted, no...

Ikari - Veteran mage needed for ritual... Can't do that...

Leo - Professional Tailors needed... 

Leo - Ikari, we can't do any of this...

Ikari - Uhhh, hehe... D-don't worry! I'll think of something! I'll get us something to eat, I promise!

??? - Hey! You two!

Leo - What? Us?

??? - Yeah! I noticed you guys have weapons, and you want a job right? You need money?

Ikari - Yes! We do! All those things!

??? - Then please help me out! I'm the foreman of the local carpentry crew, and some weird monsters appeared in the Clock Tower while we were and attacked us, and we can't get back inside! We'll pay you if you help us out!

Ikari - So lucky! Yes! We'll do it!

Leo - We will?! But we don't know how strong they are! 

Ikari - Come on, you handled those Kobolds easily, didn't you? Don't be afraid!

Leo - You said yourself they were stupid and weak..

??? - ...So will you do it or not?

Ikari - Yes! We're doing it, don't worry!

Leo - ...

??? - Great! The Clock Tower is <where it is>, please hurry, there are still other men trapped in there!

Ikari - Okay Leo! Let's go!

<entering the clock tower> 

Leo - Wow... It's pretty fancy in here, isn't it? Not quite what I expected...

Ikari - Yeah, it's pretty, isn't it?

Leo - Well, let's not get distracted, those workers need our help!

Ikari - Yeah, let's get going!

<at boss room>

Leo - Woah... This guy is pretty big...
 
Ikari - He must be the leader of them! I bet if he we take him out, any others that we missed will flee too!

Leo - Alright... We can do this! No problem! Let's go!

<after boss> 
<workers come in from off screen>
Worker - Wow! You kids really beat it? That's impressive!
Worker 2 - You really saved us, thanks a lot!
Worker 3 - Yeah! If you ever need our help with anything, come find us! We won't forget this!

<The workers leave>

Ikari - Hehe~! Maybe it could come in handy to have carpenters owe us a favor later on, you think?

Leo - I suppose it could. Let's get back and find that other guy so we can get paid, I'm starving.

<Leaving the tower, the foreman appears>

Foreman - It's you two! The other men came out and told me what you did, thank you so much!

Ikari - So, are you going to pay us?

Foreman - Yes, yes! Come meet me at the Inn, and I'll have your pay!

Ikari - Woohoo~!

<entering the inn, the foreman and workers are inside>

Foreman - There you are! Here, this your pay, we hope it's enough.

Ikari - Wow! Leo, this is enough for us to eat a lot and stay the night in the city! I'll hold on to it  for now.

Foreman - We can't thank you enough for stopping the monsters and saving my men!

All workers - We are in your debt!

Leo - Hehe... It's no problem, I guess...

Worker - Like we said before, if you ever need a favor from us, come find us again!

<the workers leave>

Ikari - Hehe~! Alright Leo, let's find something good to eat!

<You both walk outside>

Leo - So, where can we get something to eat?

Ikari - There's a restaurant around here that's really delicious! It's just the best!
- Sometimes I eat there when I get enough money, and we have plenty for now. It's enough for both of us to eat and stay at the inn tonight.

Leo - So where is it?

Ikari - It's (PUT IT SOMEWHERE) ! Let's go!

<Either have Ikari lead you there, or have her just tell you where it is.>

<Enter the Restaurant>

Ikari - Here it is! Let's go sit at the counter and you can pick out what you want!

Leo - Alright.

<You go to the counter>

Owner - Hello! Have a look at our menu, take your time!

<show that you get a menu somehow>

Leo - Hmm... Appleglaze pie, Springapple Soup, Apple and Meats platter...

Leo - ...Is there anything without apples?

Ikari - Huh? No, this place specializes in all kinds of apple foods! The owner has an orchard that he gets them all from, that's why this place is the best! The apples are so fresh!

Leo - How interesting...

<show time passed or something>

Ikari - Ahh, I'm so full! That was great! Didn't you think so, Leo?

Leo - It was pretty good. Definitely better than apples I've had back home.



??? - So, how is the next shipment going to get here then?

Owner - I'm not sure... With such a big flood, I don't know how I'll be able to get any more here at all.

Ikari - Huh? There's a flood?

Owner - Hmm? Oh, yes. I'm afraid there's been a nasty flood in Crescent Woods, and the supply route is totally blocked. I won't be able to get my carts through at all. It could be disastrous for the city's economy...

Ikari - A flood? But we were just there! And it hasn't been raining or anything...

??? - I've heard folks saying that the water spirit in Lotus Shrine is enraged. It would explain the sudden flood, but no one really knows what could have angered it so suddenly.

Ikari - Leo, this is awful! The village...

Leo - Is that the village you mentioned before?

Ikari - Yes! I've lived there for a long time since I lost my old home, and... if anything happened to it...

Leo - Is there anything I can do to help?

Ikari - Really...? You're just going to help me without even being asked?

Leo - It can't be helped anymore, can it? As long as I'm in this world, you're the only one I really know. I don't have anything else to do, or anywhere else to go, so...

Ikari - Hehe~... Thank you, Leo.

Leo - Umm... Yeah. So, do you have any ideas.

Ikari - Well... All I can think would be to visit the shrine. If the water spirit is angry, maybe I can commune with it and ask what's wrong?

Leo - Alright then... Let's go, then.

<Walk to the woods>

Ikari - Oh no... It really is flooded... This is awful.

Leo - Hmm...

Ikari - Come on, we need to get to the shrine!

<Once you reach the shrine, another cutscene starts>

Ikari - Oh no! Leo, quick, hide!

Leo - Huh, what's going on?

Ikari - Shh! Just hide over here with me! <use a plant or a stump or something>

??? - I'm afraid not... The damn thing nearly drowned me.

Leo - It's him again...

Ikari - His name is Reason... I overheard him say it before. 

Reason - After I lost track of her again, I thought if I captured the spirit, it might make up for that failure...

Leo - Who is he talking to? It looks like he's talking to that rock...

Ikari - I don't know who exactly, but those are magical stones used to communicate relatively short distances... It must mean he has allies nearby...

Reason - Unfortunately, it proved to be beyond my ability, and I nearly drowned in the shrine. This is a quite a problem, how can I return having failed twice...

<Reason walks off>

Leo - Is he gone...?

Ikari - Looks like it... Let's get inside. I should be able to commune with the spirit, so hopefully it won't try to drown us too.

Leo - Hopefully...?

<Ikari goes ahead of you>

Leo - W-wait up!
